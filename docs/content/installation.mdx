# Installation & Setup

Detailed guide for installing and configuring the Green Monkey Dashboard.

## What is the Dashboard?

The Green Monkey Dashboard is a web interface that makes it easy to configure your personalized AI agent without manually editing markdown files.

## Quick Install

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juanpasaflipz/openclaw-dashboard.git
cd openclaw-dashboard
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Using the requirements file:

```bash
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip3 install --user Flask flask-cors
```

> **Note:** If you see a PATH warning, add this to your shell profile:
> ```bash
> export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
> ```

### 3. Start the Server

```bash
python3 server.py
```

You should see:

```
============================================================
🐵 Green Monkey Dashboard Server
============================================================
Base directory: /path/to/your-project
Server starting on http://localhost:5000
Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5000
============================================================
```

Or use the launch script:

```bash
./start-dashboard.sh
```

### 4. Open in Browser

Navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Using the Dashboard

The dashboard has several tabs:

### Overview

See your configuration progress and quick access to start setup.

### Identity

Configure your AI's personality:

- **Name** — What should your AI be called?
- **Creature** — What kind of being is it? (AI assistant, digital familiar, etc.)
- **Vibe** — Personality traits (warm, witty, professional)
- **Emoji** — A signature emoji
- **Avatar** — Optional image URL or path

### User Info

Tell your AI about yourself:

- Your name and preferred name
- Pronouns
- Timezone
- Notes about your preferences and interests

### Soul & Behavior

Edit the core behavioral guidelines that define how your AI acts. The defaults are thoughtfully crafted, but fully customizable.

### Tools & Setup

Add environment-specific notes like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts
- Preferred voices for text-to-speech
- Device nicknames

### Export Config

Preview all your generated configuration files.

## Generated Files

The dashboard manages these files in your Green Monkey directory:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `IDENTITY.md` | Your AI's identity |
| `USER.md` | Information about you |
| `SOUL.md` | Behavioral guidelines |
| `TOOLS.md` | Environment-specific settings |

## Troubleshooting

### Port 5000 Already in Use

Change the port in `server.py`:

```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000, debug=True)
```

### Server Not Accessible

Make sure your firewall allows connections on port 5000.

### Changes Not Saving

Check that you have write permissions in the Green Monkey directory.

## Next Steps

After configuring your setup:

1. Review the generated markdown files
2. Delete `BOOTSTRAP.md` (you won't need it anymore)
3. Follow the [Deployment Guide](/guides/deployment) for production
4. Connect your AI to your preferred messaging platform
