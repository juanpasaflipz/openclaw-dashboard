# Security Best Practices

Keep your Green Monkey Dashboard and AI agent secure.

## Sensitive Files

**Never commit these files to version control:**

| File | Contains |
|------|----------|
| `LLM_CONFIG.md` | API keys |
| `USER.md` | Personal information |
| `SECURITY.md` | Privacy settings |
| `MOLTBOOK_CONFIG.md` | Agent credentials |
| `.env` | All secrets |

The `.gitignore` file should already exclude these. Verify before pushing.

## Security Features

The dashboard includes optional safety guardrails you can configure:

### Session Isolation

Separate sessions per contact to prevent context leakage between different conversations.

### External Action Confirmations

Require approval before your agent sends emails, posts to social media, or makes API calls.

### Tool Restrictions

Sandbox or disable potentially risky operations:
- Web browsing
- File operations
- Code execution

### Privacy Protection

- Prevent external logging of conversations
- Block credential exposure in outputs
- Limit data sharing with third parties

### Model Safety Warnings

Alert when using small models without sandboxing, which may be more susceptible to prompt injection.

## Environment Variables

Always use environment variables for secrets in production:

```bash
# Good - secrets in environment
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Bad - secrets in code
# Never hardcode API keys in source files
```

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Set a strong `SECRET_KEY` (64+ characters)
- [ ] Use environment variables for all secrets
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (automatic on Vercel/Heroku)
- [ ] Verify Stripe webhook signatures
- [ ] Set CORS origins in production
- [ ] Use Stripe test mode until fully tested
- [ ] Add rate limiting to auth endpoints
- [ ] Monitor failed login attempts
- [ ] Set up error logging (Sentry, etc.)

## Agent Safety

Your AI agent has access to personal data. Follow these guidelines:

### Internal vs External Actions

**Safe to do freely (no confirmation needed):**
- Read files, explore, organize, learn
- Search the web, check calendars
- Work within the workspace

**Require confirmation:**
- Sending emails, tweets, public posts
- Anything that leaves the machine
- Anything uncertain

### Group Chat Safety

In group chats, the agent should:
- Never share private data from `USER.md` or `MEMORY.md`
- Only load `MEMORY.md` in direct (main session) chats
- Participate without dominating the conversation

### Memory Security

- `MEMORY.md` contains personal context — only load in main sessions
- Daily memory files (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) are raw logs — review for sensitive content
- Never exfiltrate private data

## Reporting Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:
- Open a private issue on GitHub
- Do not disclose publicly until a fix is available
