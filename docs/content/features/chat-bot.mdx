# Chat Bot

The Chat Bot feature provides a conversational interface for interacting with your configured AI agent directly from the dashboard.

## Overview

Unlike the raw prompt/response style of Nautilus Direct Mode, the Chat Bot maintains a conversation history and presents interactions in a familiar chat UI.

## Features

- **Conversation history** — Messages persist within a session
- **Markdown rendering** — AI responses render with full formatting (code blocks, tables, lists)
- **Streaming responses** — See the AI's response as it generates
- **Context awareness** — The bot uses your configured identity, soul, and user profile
- **Multi-turn dialogue** — Follow-up questions maintain context from earlier in the conversation

## How to Use

1. Open the **Chat Bot** tab in the AI Workbench
2. Type your message in the input field
3. Press Enter or click Send
4. The AI responds using your configured provider and personality

## Tips

- The Chat Bot uses the same LLM provider configured in your **LLM Connection** settings
- For quick one-off prompts, consider using [Nautilus Direct Mode](/features/nautilus-ai) instead
- Clear the conversation history to start a fresh context
