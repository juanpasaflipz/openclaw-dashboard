# Web Research

The Web Research feature lets your AI agent browse and research topics on the web, bringing back summarized results directly into the dashboard.

## Overview

Rather than switching to a browser to look things up, you can ask your agent to research a topic. It will search the web, visit relevant pages, and return a concise summary.

## Features

- **Web search** — Query the web through your agent
- **Page extraction** — Pull relevant content from web pages
- **Summarization** — Get concise, AI-generated summaries of findings
- **Source attribution** — See which URLs the information came from

## How to Use

1. Open the **Web Browse** tab in the AI Workbench
2. Enter a research query or topic
3. The agent searches the web and returns summarized results
4. Review the sources and follow links for more detail

## Use Cases

- Research a topic before a meeting
- Get a quick summary of a news event
- Compare products or services
- Fact-check a claim
- Gather background on a new technology

## Notes

- Web research uses credits from your account balance
- Results depend on the quality and availability of web sources
- For sensitive research, review the [Security Guide](/guides/security) to understand data flow
