# Nautilus AI

Nautilus AI is the core intelligence layer of the Green Monkey Dashboard, offering two distinct modes for interacting with language models.

## Dual-Mode Architecture

Nautilus provides a tabbed interface with two modes:

### Direct LLM Mode

Send prompts directly to your configured language model with no middleware. This gives you raw, unfiltered access to the AI.

- Choose from multiple providers (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama)
- Select specific models per provider
- Adjust temperature and token limits
- View raw responses in real time

### Gateway Mode

Route prompts through the Green Monkey agent gateway for orchestrated, multi-step interactions. The gateway adds:

- Persistent memory across sessions
- Tool access (web search, file operations, etc.)
- Behavioral guidelines from your `SOUL.md`
- Context from your `USER.md` and `IDENTITY.md`

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Models | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Anthropic | Claude 4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Best for reasoning and long context |
| OpenAI | GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo | Wide ecosystem support |
| OpenRouter | 100+ models | Single API key for multiple providers |
| Ollama | Llama, Mistral, etc. | Run locally, no API key needed |
| Custom | Any OpenAI-compatible API | For self-hosted or niche providers |

## Configuration

1. Navigate to the **LLM Connection** tab in the dashboard
2. Select your provider
3. Enter your API key
4. Choose a default model
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify

The configuration is saved to `LLM_CONFIG.md` in your workspace.

## Usage Tips

- Use **Direct Mode** when you want fast, simple completions
- Use **Gateway Mode** when you need the agent's full capabilities (memory, tools, personality)
- Switch between modes using the tab interface at the top of the Nautilus panel
